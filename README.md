hyperactive-mouse-wrangler
=========================

Chrome extension which mitigates the mayhem that occurs when your mouse's middle button is faulty and a single click spawns 500 identical tabs. Works by throttling identical requests when they occur in rapid succession.

This exists because I dearly love my Razer Mamba in spite of its middle click misbehaviour, and I'm too cheap to shell out for another :)
